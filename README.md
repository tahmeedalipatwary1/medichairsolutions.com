Introduction:

•	Health Monitoring System:
The increasing demand for available healthcare, getting continuous, real-time data on vital signs we notify advancements in health monitoring systems. Monitoring important physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, it would be possible to monitor patients’ data even in remote environments. 
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have played a vital role in technological innovations which has been widely implemented in health monitoring systems, offering real-time data transmission and remote access to medical professionals. This evolution of biosensors has also improved the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring systems and made it reliable. 
These advancements reducing the need for regular hospital visits and enhancing the overall quality of healthcare where the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a predictive analysis of patient’s data for helping healthcare providers to make a circumstantial decision.

•	Non-Invasive
At present, monitoring vital signs those are parenting without skin or not injecting anything into the body, reducing the risk of infections, making a highly efficient clinical setting by non-invasive medical technologies. 
In modern days, we can measure blood oxygen level and pulse rates using light sensors on the skin and monitor blood pressure without using arterial catheters, are the example of non-invasive health monitoring system. 
Our study proposed a Medi-Chair, equipped with several biosensors allowing continuous health monitoring of vital signs by a user-friendly interface.

Sensors:
1.	Max30102: MAX30102 is an infrared photodetector with optical component integrated with pulse oximeter and heart rate monitor.
2. tiny GSR /EDA Sensor: GSR sensor measures skin resistance and conductivity known as electrodermal activity.
3. MAX30003: MAX 3003 is a single channel high resolution data converter which provides ECG waveforms and heart rate detection.
4. MAX30205: MAX30205 is a temperature sensor measuring temperature and provides an overtemperature alarm throughout converting the temperature measurements to digital form using a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC). 
ESP32-WROOM-32

•	Online Monitoring
In recent time, continuous health monitoring of patient’s vital signs not only in collecting or transmitting the real-time physiological data, but also allowing early detection of abnormalities like irregular heart rhythms, blood pressure fluctuations, lower glucose level and body temperature, enabling timely medical interventions.
For improving clinical outcomes, online monitoring compelled by customized software and website with effective security, demonstrated a cost-effective model by reducing the hospital visits of those patients with hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and so on.
Medi-Chair aims a non-invasive vital monitoring solution, utilizing bio-sensors with a foldable LED display for patient’s own monitoring and customized software would be available for the healthcare professionals.

•	User Friendly Interface
Impacts on user experience and engagement, a well-designed user-friendly interface (UFI) is an impactful adoption for easy navigation and effectful interaction for both patients and medical professionals. 
Incorporating principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) into the design of healthcare applications is paramount. A user-friendly interface must consider the diverse needs of its users, including those with limited technological proficiency. Effective UFI design can reduce the cognitive load on users, allowing them to focus on managing their health rather than struggling with complex software. 
As we explore the Medi-Chair's capabilities, it becomes evident that a user-friendly interface is not just an optional feature but a fundamental component that can determine the success of non-invasive vital monitoring systems. By integrating user feedback and iterative design practices, the Medi-Chair aims to create an accessible and engaging platform that empowers patients to take charge of their health while facilitating efficient data management for healthcare providers.
